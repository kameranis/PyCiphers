# PyCiphers
Library containing basic cipher implementations.

Thus far I have added the following ciphers:
1. (Affine) Caesar Cipher
2. Vigenere Cipher
3. Playfair Cipher
4. One-Time Pad Cipher

Each cipher is called as
```
encrypted = PyCiphers.Caesar.encrypt("Spam, Sausage and Spam", 13)
```
This plan serves to learn more about ciphers, and python coding conventions
